# core
This core module provides a base implementation for a microservice and is used to create a cluster of managed, zero-trust microservices. The core module provides prebuilt handshaking procedures (graphql) for microservices to register and unregister with one another. Other out-of-the-box features include server-to-server communincation and security, server status and health checks, client-side load-balancing, inversion of control/dependency injection, supporting synchronous REST and GraphQL, and asynchronous (AMQP) interface requests and responses., etc. Using the CLI (separate module), developers can quickly scalfold production-grade service-registry, api-gateway, auth, logger, and other extendable microservices that together, function as a managed cluster.
