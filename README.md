# core
This core module provides a base implementation for a microservice and is used to create a cluster of managed, zero-trust microservices. The core module provides prebuilt handshaking procedures (graphql) for microservices to register and unregister with one another. Using the CLI (separate module), developers can quickly scalfold production-grade service-registry, api-gateway, auth, logger, and other extendable microservice.
